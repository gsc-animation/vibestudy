# Task Log: Task 1.1 – Workspace & Repository Initialization

## Summary
Initialized the project workspace by creating a standard `.gitignore` file for a Node.js project and a `README.md` file documenting the multi-terminal workflow.

## Details
- Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude common Node.js files and directories.
- Verified the existence of the `frontend/` and `backend/` directories.
- Created a `README.md` file in the root directory.

## Output
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`

## Issues
- The `Architect` mode was initially restricted from creating the `.gitignore` file.

## Ad-Hoc Agent Delegation
- Switched to `Code` mode to create the `.gitignore` file due to file permissions in `Architect` mode.

## Next Steps
